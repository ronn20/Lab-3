Observation notes:

1: We closed the dome doors to stop the wind from shaking the telescope as much as it was, accepting any resulting (very small) error due to resulting temperature gradients.

2: The original 20-second dark frames (not the flushed ones) showed slightly warm pixels in the pattern of the flat frame, leading us to think we slightly overexposed the camera to the flat frame light and the pixels warmed up a bit. Repeatedly "flushing" the camera by taking biases cleared this effect away (or at least very close to away), and we took new "flushed" 20-second darks. Since the flats were taken directly before the darks, we do not expect this problem to appear anywhere else.

3: One of the 60-second darks has what is probably a cosmic ray, and must be found (in ds9, for example) and thrown out.
